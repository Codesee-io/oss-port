## Project setup

**Requirements:**

- Node v14 or above
- Yarn: `npm install --global yarn`

**First-time setup:**

1. check out this repository and navigate into it with `cd oss-port`
2. install the dependencies: `yarn`

ðŸš€ When you've completed the setup steps, run the app:

```
yarn dev
```

### github.dev environment

You can also contribute to OSH without having to run the app on your local machine! Go ahead and check out the github.dev steps below.

If you have a JavaScript development environment set up already and prefer to run locally, the approach will be familiar.

1. [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the OSH.
1. Once on your fork's page, either press the full stop `.` key or replace `.com` in the location bar in your browser to `.dev`.

Now you're in the github.dev editor! Feel free to hop ahead to [our contributing section](#contributing).

For more information on the Github.dev editor, please [see their docs](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor).

## How to list your project

1. Get the project up and running first
1. Create your project's `.mdx` file:
   1. Create a new folder inside `/public/projects/` and name it the same as your GitHub handle or organization
   1. Add a new `.mdx` file to that folder, and give it the name of your public repo. For example,
      - if your project URl is: `https://github.com/Codesee-io/oss-port`
      - you would create: `/public/projects/Codesee-io/oss-port.mdx`.
   1. Copy/paste the contents of [`/app/projects/_template.mdx`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codesee-io/oss-port/main/app/projects/_template.mdx) into that file
1. Fill out the information â€” most of it is optional, but extremely helpful for potential contributors. If you opt not to include the optional content, delete it from your template.
1. Add a 200x200 image for your organization to your folder, for example, `./app/projects/distributeaid/da.png`
1. Preview your changes by running `yarn dev`
1. When you're ready, open a PR!

### How to add a CodeSee Map to your project listing

Make it easier for contributors to onboard to your project! With a CodeSee Map, they can visualize the entire codebase, with features allowing them to explore system dependencies, add additional context to pull requests, and more.

To add a Map to your project:

1. Sign up for [CodeSee Maps](https://codesee.io) (there's no commitment or cost!)
1. Create a Map for your repo following [our instructions](https://docs.codesee.io/en/latest/)
1. Set your map to public!
1. Add an entry in your project's template for the Map (see example from Distribute Aid's Shipment Tracker project):

```
featuredMap:
  url: https://app.codesee.io/maps/public/848e3630-1650-11ec-8bc1-7d4a4822cc27
  description: Get a quick overview of the major areas of our repo
```

If you would like to display multiple maps you can add an entry called "maps"

```
maps:
  - url: https://app.codesee.io/maps/public/848e3630-1650-11ec-8bc1-7d4a4822cc27
    description: Get a quick visual overview of the major areas of our repo!
    subTitle: devdocs
  - url: https://app.codesee.io/maps/public/848e3630-1650-11ec-8bc1-7d4a4822cc27
    description: Another map!
    subTitle: testMap
```

That's it!

The CodeSee Map below is a good way to get familiar with the codebase:
