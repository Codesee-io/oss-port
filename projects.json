Instructions can be written in the editor, and when they are executed, the registers and memory in the emulator get updated accordingly. There are a few steps which happen in the background to make this possible.\n\n1. An object of the [Emulator](./src/emulator/emulator.js) class is exported, which is the point of interaction between the frontend and the emulation logic.\n\n2. First, the [lexer](./src/emulator/parser/lexer.js) divides the source code into tokens and sends them to a [parser](./src/emulator/parser/parser.js). The parser is responsible for extracting instructions from the tokens and converting them to a form that the `CPU` understands.\n\n3. The [CPU](./src/emulator/cpu/core.js) reads the mnemonic and the operands that were sent to it by the parser, and according to these values, it executes the instructions.\n\n> Note: The communication between the parser and the CPU is NOT in terms of `shellcode`, i.e, `opcode`s and `operands`. The CPU recognizes an instruction by it's `mnemonic`, such as `MOV` or `ADD`.",

Commit and push to your repo.\n6. Compare and pull request against this repo's master branch.\n\n## Tips\n- Smaller changes are easier to review\n- Write tests for your changes \n    - This project uses [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)\n    - Tests should go in the `test` directory. Mirror the same package structure in `test` as in `main`\n    - Test classes meeting the regex *Test.java will automatically be included by the framework's test runner\n    - In order to run the tests, you must have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed\n    - Run the tests by running `mvn test` from the command-line.\n- Document the fix in the code to make the code more readable\n- File a PR with meaningful title, description and commit messages.\n- To close an issue (e.g. issue 1542) automatically after a PR is merged, use keywords \"fix\", \"close\", \"resolve\" in the PR description, e.g. `fix #51`."

Ziti has several components.\n\n**Quick Reference**\n* [Documentation](https://openziti.github.io/)\n* [Developer Overview](https://github.com/openziti/ziti/blob/master/doc/001-overview.md)\n* [Local Development](https://github.com/openziti/ziti/blob/master/doc/002-local-dev.md)\n* [Local Deployment](https://github.com/openziti/ziti/blob/master/doc/003-local-deploy.md)\n* [Release Notes](https://github.com/openziti/ziti/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## What is Ziti?\n* The Ziti fabric provides a scalable, plugable, networking mesh with built in smart routing\n* The Ziti edge components provide a secure, Zero Trust entry point into your network\n* The Ziti SDKs allow you to integrate Ziti directly into your applications\n* The Ziti tunnelers and proxies allow existing applications and networks to take advantage of a Ziti deployment \n\n**Security Features**\n* Zero Trust and Application Segmentation\n* Dark Services and Routers\n* End to end encryption\n\n**Performance and Reliability**\n* A scalable mesh fabric with smart routing\n* Support for load balancing services for both horizontal scale and failover setups \n\n**Developer Focus**\n* [Open source code, available with the Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/openziti)\n* Fully programmable REST management APIs\n* [SDKs for a variety of programming languages](https://openziti.github.io/ziti/clients/sdks)\n* [Application specific configuration store allowing centralized management of configuration allowing you to add structured configuration specific to your application](https://openziti.github.io/ziti/config-store/overview)\n* An extensible fabric, allowing you to add your own \n    * load balancing algorithms\n    * interconnect protocols\n    * ingress and egress protocols\n    * metrics collections frameworks\n    * control and management plane messaging and semantics   \n\n**Easy Management**\n* [A flexible and expressive policy model for managing access to services and edge routers](https://openziti.github.io/ziti/policies/overview)\n* A web based admin console\n* [Pre-built tunnelers and proxies for a variety of operating systems, including mobile](https://openziti.github.io/ziti/clients/tunneler)\n\nLet's break some of these buzzwords down.\n\n### Zero Trust/Application Segmentation\nMany networking security solutions act like a wall around an internal network. Once you are through the wall, you have access to everything inside. Zero trust solutions enforce not just access to a network, but access to individual applications within that network. \n\nEvery client in a Ziti system must have an identity with provisioned certificates. The certificates are used to establish secure communications channels as well as for authentication and authorization of the associated identity. Whenever the client attempts to access a network application, Ziti will first ensure that the identity has access to the application. If access is revoked, open network connections will be closed.\n\nThis model enables Ziti systems to provide access to multiple applications while ensuring that clients only get access to those applications to which they have been granted access.    \n\nIn addition to requiring cert based authentication for clients, Ziti uses certificates to authorize communication between Ziti components. \n\n### Dark Services and Routers\nThere are various levels of accessibility a network application/service can have.\n\n1. Many network services are available to the world. The service then relies on authentication and authorization policies to prevent unwanted access. \n1. Firewalls can be used to limit access to specific IP or ranges. This increases security at the cost of flexibility. Adding users can be complicated and users may not be able to easily switch devices or access the service remotely.\n1. Services can be put behind a VPN or made only accessible to an internal network, but there are some downsides to this approach.\n    1. If you can access the VPN or internal network for any reason, all services in that VPN become more vulnerable to you.\n    1. VPNs are not usually appropriate for external customers or users.\n    1. For end users, VPNs add an extra step that needs to be done each time they want to access the service.\n1. Services can be made dark, meaning they do not have any ports open for anyone to even try and connect to. \n\nMaking something dark can be done in a few ways, but the way it's generally handled in Ziti is that services reach out and establish one or more connections to the Ziti network fabric. Clients coming into the fabric can then reach the service through these connections after being authenticated and authorized. \n\nZiti routers, which make up the fabric, can also be dark. Routers locoated in private networks will usually be made dark. These routers will reach out of the private network to talk to the controller and to make connections to join the network fabric mesh. This allows the services and routers in your private networks to make only outbound connections, so no holes have to opened for inbound traffic.\n\nServices can be completely dark if they are implemented with a Ziti SDK. If this is not possible a Ziti tunneler or proxy can be colocated with the service. The service then only needs to allow connections from the local machine or network, depending on how close you colocate the proxy to the service.   \n\n### End to End Encryption\nIf you take advantage of Ziti's developer SDKs and embed Ziti in your client and server applications, your traffic can be configured to be seamlessly encrypted from the client application to server application. If you prefer to use tunnelers or proxy applications, the traffic can be ecnrypted for you from machine to machine or private network to private network. Various combinations of the above are also supported.\n\nEnd-to-end encryption means that even if systems between the client and server are compromised, your traffic cannot be decrypted or tampered with.\n\n## Getting started with Ziti\n\nIf you are looking to jump right in feet first you can follow along with one of our [up-and-running quickstart\nguides](~/ziti/quickstarts/quickstart-overview.md). The quickstart will leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) and will have you\nlaunch an AMI which will get you up and running in no time.\n\nThis environment is perfect for evaluators to get to know Ziti and the capabilities it offers.  The environement was not\ndesigned for large scale deployment or for long-term usage. If you are looking for a managed service to help you run a\ntruly global, scalable network browse over to our website at http://netfoundry.io to learn more.\n\n\nThe CodeSee Map below is a good way to get familiar with the Ziti codebase:",

    "overviewSection": "# Introduction\n\nJZookeeperEdit is a tool to help with browsing and modifying data in Apache Zookeeper.\n\n## Why does it exist\n\nThis tool came to be out of a need to clean up large numbers of Zookeeper entries (ZNodes). Older versions of Apache Kafka would create a new node every time you used the cli without assigning a group so you could easily end up with thousands or more.\nThis becomes problematic when you need to modify an entry in Zookeeper because first you have to find it amid the mass of entries and the command line tool that comes with Zookeeper (zkcli) is not very bash friendly and is extremely slow when trying to clear up large numbers of nodes.\nEven just browsing these trees can be very slow once they are big enough.\n\nAs such the first version of this tool was made while we waited for a very slow bash script to try and delete a few hundred thousand nodes with three main goals\n\n* Make searching and exploring Zookeeper with regular expressions easy\n* Make editing the Data on a ZNode easy\n* Make deleting large numbers of nodes easy but safe\n\nIn the end the first version of this app was written and successfully cleared all the data long before the bash script had even managed 10% of the nodes.\nSeeing how useful it was we decided to polish it up and contribute it to the community to make this sort of task easy for all.\nIn this expanded scope we wanted to add a number of additional features\n\n* A cli that was bash friendly\n* Multiple cluster support\n* A better UI\n* Kerberos support\n* ACL support\n* Versions supporting a subset of useful versions of Zookeeper, namely the current versions used within the Big Data ecosystem like the ones that are part of Kafka and Hadoop as well as the Latest stable version.\n* Searching within ZNode data\n\nThere are other tools that allow good browsing of a Zookeeper instance via a web UI, but few if any allow editing and most require someone to set up a server.\nJZookeeperEdit in comparison is a single binary with convenient installers which can be used from the CLI or launched like a normal app.\n\nThis is a tool intended for people that just need to work with Zookeeper and don't want the faff.\n\nYou can read more details on the [project page](http://feldoh.github.io/JZookeeperEdit/)",
    "contributingSection": "Thankyou for your interest in contributing to JZookeeperEdit. This project is very open to contibutions, from people of all skill levels and backgrounds. Documentation, Wiki changes, packaging etc are all valued.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, you will need an issue number for your PR to be accepted.\n\nIf making CLI changes keep in mind this project aims to be CLI friendly, so think about how calls could be chained, ideally provide examples in the README.md.\n\nAll pull requests should target develop unless a special exemption is made such as for a critical fix. Release versions will be regularly cut from develop after sufficient testing.\n\nAll pull requests must begin with an issue number in their commit message e.g \"#10 Add a thing\"\n\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\nYou can find out more in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/feldoh/JZookeeperEdit/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) or come and have a chat over on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/JZookeeperEdit/Lobby)\n\n## Help Needed\n\nThere is always plenty of work to do in this project, check the issues for good options. Some of the tickets should be very easy and a great introduction to open source, some simple refactoring and upgrades.\nThere are also some much more involved tickets for anyone that really wants to get stuck in and collaborate.\n\nThe most critical are probably:\n\n* Switching away from BinTray as it has been deprecated in favour of artifactory\n* Testing of the JavaFX based GUI. Testing JavaFX is very hard, be warned but anyone with experience would be much appreciated\n* Update to latest versions\n* Add a way to dump entire subtrees or indeed a whole instance to some sort of archive and restore them\n* Make it easier to contribute by getting GitHub Codespaces or some other one click environent setup working for this project\n* Fix native binary creation. Creation of RPMs, MSIs, DEBs etc is broken with the new Gluon based OpenFX Maven Plugin\n\nThere is also the potential to replace JavaFX, this is a big task but it is clear JavaFX is more complex than it is worth now it is no longer included in the JRE and is very hard to build.\n\nThis project might seem a little unloved but that is because the upgrade to Java 9+ broke quite a lot of things quite badly so most people still use the pre-compiled binaries that until recently were on BinTray.\nIt would be great to get this project back into a more live state and able to keep up with Zookeper releases again.\n\nIdeally we would also acquire at least one more long term maintainer."

After this, create a pull request for your feature branch to the development branch.\nPlease do not create PRs against the master branch.\n\n## An example workflow\n\nAfter you've followed the steps in the [Setup Guide](./SETUP.md), think of a meaningful\nname for the branch you're about to make and run these commands:\n\n`git checkout -b my-cool-branch-name`\n\nWrite your code and try to make meaningful commits. Here's an example:\n\n```cmd\n# Write some code\n$> git commit -am \"Add new class to a module\"\n# Make some more changes\n$> git commit -am \"Add test for new class\"\n ```\n\nOnce you've finished, please run all tests and correct any new failures. To run\nall tests, run the following from the terminal while in the project root:\n\n`python -m unittest discover tests`\n\nOnce you've committed everything, run:\n\n`git push origin my-cool-branch-name`\n\nThen, head over to the [repository on Github](https://github.com/erik-whiting/LuluTest)\nand create your pull request **against the development branch**. That's it!\n\n### A note on testing\n\nPull requests without tests will most likely be rejected unless the work\nyou've done is minor enough that a test would be overkill. If you're an\nabsolute beginner, don't let this scare you! Writing tests is good practice,\nand there are most likely enough tests in the `tests`\ndirectory that you can figure out what you need to do :)\n\nKeep in mind, this framework is designed to be a tool for software testing\nand quality assurance, lets practice what we preach.\n\n## Issue Label Guide\n\n* Beginner Friendly - Issues tagged with this label are so tagged because they\nare likely within the realm of a novice Pythoneer\n* Bug - These issues are functionality-breaking issues that prevent the\nsoftware from doing what a user would expect\n* Documentation - These issues revolve around documenting the system with\nthings like READMEs, set up guides, various Wikis, etc\n* Duplicate - Issues will be marked duplicate if they have already been\naddressed\n* Enhancement - These issues are for taking LuluTest from what it is now, to\nwhat we want it to be. It includes adding features as well as refactoring\n* Good First Issue - These are issues that will help newcomers to the *project*\nin getting acquainted with the project, not necessarily new programmers\n* Help Wanted - These issues are either beyond the expertise of the current\ncontributors or need further discussion with someone who knows about the issue\nat hand\n* Integration and Management - Issues around building a CI server, setting up a\nSlack chat, and deployment/packaging solutions fall under this label"

Most tasks will be driven by content requirements, so please coordinate with the requesting content creator for context, sample content, and additional details.\n\nIssues tagged front end will also be tagged with:\n\n* `needs sample content` - A content creator needs to create sample content to show what information will be presented.\n* `needs UI mock` - A designer needs to create a UI mock of the component.\n* `has content & UI mock` - The task is ready for development!\n\nWhen you begin working on an issue, please self-assign or comment on it indicating you're beginning work to avoid duplicate effort.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nWhen you're ready to submit your code, open a pull request with \"Closes #X\" to link the relavant issue. When your PR is approved by at least one maintainer it is ready to submit.\n\nIt's easy for the intention of code review comments to be unclear or get misinterpreted. To help with communication, reviewers are encouraged to use [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) and explicitly indicate that comments are `(blocking)`, where the discussion must be resolved for PR to be merged, or `(non-blocking)` where resolving the discussion is optional for the implementer.\n\n#### Approval and merging\n\nReviewers should grant approval if they do not feel additional review is necessary before merging. This does not necessarily mean no more changes are required before merging, but that any further changes are expected to be minor enough to not require review.\n\nIf the pull request does not require additional changes, the reviewer should merge it immediately after approving. Otherwise, the pull request author should merge (if able) once they have addressed all comments marked `(blocking)` or `nit`. Contributors are encouraged to at least reply to `(non-blocking)` and `(if-minor)` comments if they do not address them with code changes.\n\nTechnologies Used\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Our Content \"Supply Chain\"\n\nThe Distribute Aid Landing Site is a static TypeScript website generated by GatsbyJS with content from the Contentful headless CMS.\n\n**Content Management**\n\n* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) headless cms\n\n**General Tools**\n\n* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n* [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/)\n\n**Build Tools**\n\n* [Gatsby.js](http://gatsbyjs.org/)\n\n**Front End**\n\n* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)\n* [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n\n**Production**\n\n* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) build runner & hosting\n\n\nPrevious Work & Credits\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInitial commit bootstrapped off of [Contentful Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/contentful/starter-gatsby-blog/) which is MIT licensed.\n\nThe original DA Landing Site project can be found at [https://gitlab.com/distribute-aid/landing](https://gitlab.com/distribute-aid/landing). <3",

It does not require a very deep understanding of the codebase to make the first contribution and also\nhas well documented steps to get you started."

It can tell you about its symptoms, precaution and description of the disease.

Using this system Fuel Theft can be stopped too. The system can also facilitate on-time vehicle maintenance.
