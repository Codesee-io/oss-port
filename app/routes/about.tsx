          <p>
            Open-Source Hub was created to connect projects to people and ease
            codebase onboarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintainers can tag their projects to topics like ‘education’ and
            ‘social good’, so contributors can search, select, and quickly
            onboard to the projects that matter most to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open-Source Hub allows maintainers to provide contribution best
            practices, support guidance, and interactive visual walkthroughs of
            their codebase using CodeSee Maps.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Maps, understand how files are connected, see how a pull
            request fits into the larger architecture, and more.
