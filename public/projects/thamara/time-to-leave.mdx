<Overview>

[Time to Leave](https://timetoleave.app/) is a desktop application that allows a user to log the time they started working today, and the application will compute what time they should leave the office, considering the time you spent on lunch. When it's time, the program will issue a notification.

It's possible to track the working hours, overtime, holidays and more.

It's developed using **Electron**, with **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**. We also have helper scripts in **Python**.

If programming is not your thing, we also need help translating Time to Leave into new languages, developing more tests, and more.
