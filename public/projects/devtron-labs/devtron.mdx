<Overview>

Devtron is an open source software delivery workflow for kubernetes. It is known for its slick user interface which allows developers to deploy their microservices over kubernetes in no-time. It also annihilate the well known pain of managing multiple devops tools simultaneously by bringing the different tools under the same roof called Devtron. It integrates with the existing open-source systems like ArgoCD, Argo Workflow, Clair, Hibernator, Grafana, Prometheus, Casbin, and many others and adds capabilities on top of them to enable self-serve for developers and DevOps.
