<Overview>

Welcome! This is a project that came from wanting to learn Rust and making a CLI tool.

It allows you to read RSS feeds for written content in your terminal, rendered lovingly in Markdown.

To run in development, start with the following command:

`$ cargo run -- <URL_TO_FEED.xml>`

For example, you can run:

`$ cargon run -- https://ramonh.dev/blog/feed.xml`

Let's have fun together learning Rust!
