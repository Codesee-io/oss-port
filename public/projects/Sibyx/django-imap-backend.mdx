<Overview>
IMAP back-end for `django.core.mail` package, aimed for uploading messages to specif mailboxes, instead of sending it
over SMTP (or other Django email backend). Useful for debugging without fancy services like
[mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/). Library is capable of uploading messages to multiple accounts at once (one email
to multiple mailboxes or accounts).

In last few months I worked on project where we have to send a lot of emails to different mailboxes. We used fake
(and after migration real) e-mail addresses in our staging environment. It was hard to debug these messages without
services like [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) (for which we just didn't want to pay, even it's a pretty cool product,
client's budget is client's budged).

We came up with the idea of uploading ready-to-send emails to IMAP user instead of sending it.
