<Overview>

The main idea was to create a simple and declarative way to specify the format of expecting requests with the ability
to validate them. Firstly I tried to use [Django Forms](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/) to
validate my API requests (I use pure Django in my APIs). I have encountered a problem with nesting my requests without
a huge boilerplate. Also, the whole HTML thing was pretty useless in my RESTful APIs.

I wanted to:

- define my requests as object (`Form`),
- pass the request to my defined object (`form = Form.create_from_request(request)`),
- validate my request `form.is_valid()`,
- extract data `form.clean_data` property.

I wanted to keep:

- friendly declarative Django syntax,
([DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/forms.py#L22) is beautiful),
- [Validators](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/validators/),
- [ValidationError](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/exceptions/#validationerror),
- [Form fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/forms/fields/) (In the end, I had to "replace" some of them).

So I have decided to create a simple Python package to cover all my expectations.

Feel free to open pull requests but please keep in mind this checklist:

- write tests
- write changes to to `CHANGELOG.md`
- update `README.md` (if needed)
- update documentation (if needed)

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Please write your source code according to the
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code-style. [flake8](https://github.com/pycqa/flake8) is used for
code-style and code-quality checks. Please, be sure that your IDE is following settings according to `.editorconfig`
file.

We use [Django-style tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/overview/).

Documentation is places in `docs` directory and it's generated using
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). You can build docs calling `poetry run mkdocs build`.
Docs will be in `sites` directory after build. Documentation is updated after every push to `origin/master` branch
using GitHub Actions.
