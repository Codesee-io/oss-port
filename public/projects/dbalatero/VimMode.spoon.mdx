<Overview>

:rocket: This library will add Vim motions and operators to all your input fields on OS X. Why should Emacs users have all the fun?

This uses Hammerspoon, but don't worry - the quick installer is a 1-line bash command to get everything setup.

Not all motions or operators are implemented, but you can open an issue if you're missing something.

The plugin will not work with system inputs marked as secure, such as password fields or anything in 1Password, as it can't read those fields!
