<Overview>

8086.js is a basic 8086 emulator built using Javascript, hosted at https://roerohan.github.io/8086.js/.

## Basic Workflow

The UI is split into 2 major halves, the right half is the `editor` and the left half is the `emulator`. Instructions can be written in the editor, and when they are executed, the registers and memory in the emulator get updated accordingly. There are a few steps which happen in the background to make this possible.

1. An object of the [Emulator](./src/emulator/emulator.js) class is exported, which is the point of interaction between the frontend and the emulation logic.

2. First, the [lexer](./src/emulator/parser/lexer.js) divides the source code into tokens and sends them to a [parser](./src/emulator/parser/parser.js). The parser is responsible for extracting instructions from the tokens and converting them to a form that the `CPU` understands.

3. The [CPU](./src/emulator/cpu/core.js) reads the mnemonic and the operands that were sent to it by the parser, and according to these values, it executes the instructions.

> Note: The communication between the parser and the CPU is NOT in terms of `shellcode`, i.e, `opcode`s and `operands`. The CPU recognizes an instruction by it's `mnemonic`, such as `MOV` or `ADD`.
