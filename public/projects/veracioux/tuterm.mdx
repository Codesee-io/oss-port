I created this project to help people learn the CLI, help developers create
tutorials for their CLI projects and to learn more CLI programs myself!

The project is written in bash and it's not very large.

If you have any ideas, contributions or any kind of questions, please don't
hesitate to open issues, submit pull requests or send me an email. Any kind of
interaction proves to me that this project is worthwhile.

I do this in my free time, so I would very much appreciate your help. Please
also check out a spin-off project:
[A collection of tutorials for popular CLI programs](https://github.com/veracioux/tuterm-collection).
