### NLP MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

This project deals with the creation of certain notes from a book.

This project involves one of the research work of creating a project that deals with the creation of visually interactive graphs when we pass that module any kind of notebook of any kind of image file you just need to specify the type of image you need to pass on to that document and it will do all the hard work for you by itself by creating of certain nodes with the help of one of the most advanced library of python for desktop creation using Tkinter.

This project uses the help of certain great libraries of python:-
* Tkinter
* Pillow
* NLTK
* Pytesseract
* re
* numpy
* WordNetLemmatizer
* stopwords
* PypDF2
* Translator

You can enjoy certain features of these vast set of features by just passing the module with the required image or pdf file and then by passing the image it will draw the graph for you and then after that we can also translate that in any other language for active understanding of that project.
This also introduce you to the concept of NLP which aims to understand the semantics from the text and the create a short prescribed format in order to create a summary of the document into a simple graphical structure.
