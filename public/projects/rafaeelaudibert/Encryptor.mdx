<Overview>

Several encryptors (cryptographic secure or not) available in a REST API fashion, using Flask.

You might check our CodeSee map [here](https://app.codesee.io/maps/public/fba69790-2df1-11ec-ab8c-99eaa34b065f). If you want a walkthrough of our codebase we also have a CodeSee tour [here](https://app.codesee.io/maps/5b42cc90-2df3-11ec-80d0-7d2f654f857e).
