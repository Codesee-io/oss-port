<Overview>

We were inspired to create it when we saw that not many tools are available open-source or on the Internet which do the job we intend to do. So we decided to create it as a side-project based purely to learn and have some fun juggling with Github APIs'.
Getting your Github profile under a single page in a resume type-of format so that you can simply put your Github resume when applying to internships or job profiles.

## üîÜ Tech Stack

The project is created using create-react-app and based on React.js framework.

- JavaScript: 84.5%
- HTML: 10.3%
- CSS: 5.2%

## üë¨ Design and Roadmap

The [Roadmap](https://www.figma.com/file/czzHjTUJS94Rl676D8up5s/GitSetGo?node-id=0%3A1) we intended to follow is present here. Feel free to suggest ideas and opinions.

## How to run?

Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/garimasingh128/gitsetgo`<br/>
Change to the project directory
`cd gitsetgo`
In the project directory, you can run:

Run `npm install` to install `node_modules`. You may receive an error telling you `node_modules` missing otherwise.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br/>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` directory.<br/>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br/>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## ‚ú® Future Plans

- Github Timeline
- Github competition between two users
- Personalised template for resume
- Enhancing the existing resume template
- Showing Github feed of others

`Feel free to create issues to suggest and add functionalities and features.`

## üíª System Requirements

- Google Chrome
- Git
- Code Editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

<Contributing>

A few guidelines for someone looking to contribute here:

## If you're a beginner

- `Fork` this repository.
- `Clone` your fork on local machine.

- Checkout to the new branch with `git checkout <new_branch_name>`
- Do the desired changes and `commit` them with `git commit -m '<a nice commit message here>'`.
- `push` the change to your fork on GitHub with `git push origin <your_branch_name>`
- Make a `Pull Request` to the original repository, i.e. this one.

<b>
  Note: If you're looking to work on an issue, just make sure that no one else
  has taken it already. In which case, you can look up other issues or create a
  new one if you find something missing! ;){" "}
</b>

Some guidelines related to the code:

- Try to stick to the syntax style followed in the code. This will help everyone to understand your code.
- Make sure you put comments wherever necessary.
- Include a visual preview (a screenshot or a GIF?) for any visual design changes if possible.

If you want to add a new feature, feel free to do so! :D

Happy Contributing! :v:
