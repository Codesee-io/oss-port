<Overview>
The main idea is to provide a seamless interface for creating memes on web, while I have personally enjoyed creating memes on apps in phones but sometimes you just need a web-app on a big screen. 
This is my solution to that problem.

It is using ReactJS and custom CSS (though I want to move to a CSS-framework at some point).  
Feel free to checkout the issues that I have created and if you have an idea which you don't find captured in the issues, feel free to create new ones
