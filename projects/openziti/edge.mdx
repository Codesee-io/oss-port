# Ziti
Ziti is a modern, programmable network overlay with associated edge components, for application-embedded, zero trust network connectivity, written by developers for developers. 
Ziti allows developers to take control of networking while with secure connectivity and advanced security concepts such as Zero Trust.

The Ziti Edge implements the application-embedded connectivity and zero trust components of the Ziti ecosystem.
