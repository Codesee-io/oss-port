<Overview>

Simple e-book catalog server compatible with OPDS 1.2 written in Python with simple management REST API
(basic CRUD operations).

The main reason I created this project was to create ability to synchronise the Calibre in the client-server way, with
multi-tenant abilities and possibility of multiple calibre clients. This repository contains just the server
implementation and could be use without the Calibre (of course) as standalone OPDS server.
