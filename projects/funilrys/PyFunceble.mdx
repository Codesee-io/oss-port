<Overview>

**PyFunceble** is a tool that tries to provide an accurate availability check 
through the usage of multiple sources which are for example - to only list them:

- the WHOIS record(s).
- the DNS record(s).
- the HTTP status code.

It can be included in your existing project through:

- a CLI that can test from a hosts file, a plain list of subjects, an
  AdBlock filter list or even an RPZ record.
- its [Python API](https://pyfunceble.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api/index.html).
- the [PyFunceble web-worker](https://github.com/pyfunceble/web-worker) project that provides the core functionalities
  of PyFunceble behind a web API.

It is mainly used by many projects or infrastructure to:

- continuously  (re-)test the availability of IP, domains or URLs
- filter inactive IP, domains or URLs from hosts files, lists of domain, adblock list
- ... and a lot more!

</Overview>

<Contributing>

The project just reached a new milestone with its new `4.0.0` version. 
It is still open to improvement and new ideas, there is certainly somewhere you can contribute or help!

We are - in our free time - trying to build a web-based testing infrastructure to eliminate or reduce the overall testing time.
Therefore, we are looking for new contributors that are interested in such a project (all sides are welcome!).

Everyone is welcome to contribute with code, idea or documentation!
