# Run this Project on Local Environment:

**Prerequisites**

1. NodeJS installed on your Local machine
2. MongoDB installed on your local machine or have an Atlas Account.
3. A Gmail Account for Firebase Services.
4. A PayPal Account and a Sandbox account for testing purposes. (For now, you can ignore this step, Currently I am planning to shift payment services to Stripe/RazorPay)

**Credentials Setup**

1. Create a `MongoDB Atlas` Account for connecting this app with MongoDB or you can use your local MongoDB. Find Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKyag6t98g8).
2. Setup a `Firebase Project` for using `Firestore and Authentication`. Find Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6juww5Lmvgo).
3. Setup [Firestore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFLvSp4Mh9k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB&index=2) and [Enable Authenitaion Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OKrloDzGpU)
4. Generate `Private keys for Firebase Admin`. Find tutorials [here](https://youtu.be/WtYzHTXHBp0).
5. Create a `PayPal account` and `Sandbox account`. Find Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtZGoueL4Vs&t=293s)

**Project Setup**
- Clone this Repository or Download the zip File   
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/nil1729/food-order-app.git
    ```
- Create a new file named `secret.json` on `config` directory which contains Generated Private keys from Firebase project.
    ```
    {
        "type": "service_account",
        ...
    }
    ```
- Create another `cofig.js` file on `/client/src/firebase`. Put all firebase config Credentials for Frontend. (In following Format)
    ```
      const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "",
          authDomain: "",
          databaseURL: "",
          projectId: "",
          storageBucket: "",
          messagingSenderId: "",
          appId: "",
          measurementId: ""
      };
      export default firebaseConfig;
    ```
- Create a `.env` file on root directory. Which Contains all necessary Secret Credentials (for backend only) for this site.  
    ```
      DB_URI = <- Mongo Atlas URI->
      PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = <- PayPal Sandbox Client ID (Also use your own client ID on Frontend)->
      PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = <- PayPal Sandbox Client Secret (Only for backend server to verify purchase)->
    ```
- Run this Command   
    ```
      $ npm run dev  // to start Vue Development server and Backend server together.
