<Overview>

Simple food ordering web application built using VueJS, Firebase, NodeJS and MongoDB.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nil1729/food-order-app/master/previews/preview.jpg)

## Checkout the Live Demo of this project First:
  - Test User Credentials
    - Email: `user@gmail.co`
    - Password: `123456`
  - Test Admin Credentials
    - Email: `admin@foodsite.com`
    - Password: `123456`

## Run this Project on Local Environment:

1. **Prerequisites**

   - NodeJS installed on your Local machine
   - MongoDB installed on your local machine or have an Atlas Account.
   - A Gmail Account for Firebase Services.
   - A PayPal Account and a Sandbox account for testing purposes. (For now, you can ignore this step, Currently I am planning to shift payment services to Stripe/RazorPay)

2. **Credentials Setup**

   - Create a `MongoDB Atlas` Account for connecting this app with MongoDB or you can use your local MongoDB. Find Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKyag6t98g8).
   - Setup a `Firebase Project` for using `Firestore and Authentication`. Find Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6juww5Lmvgo).
   - Setup [Firestore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFLvSp4Mh9k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itfjle0ji1xOZ2cjRGY_WB&index=2) and [Enable Authenitaion Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OKrloDzGpU)
   - Generate `Private keys for Firebase Admin`. Find tutorials [here](https://youtu.be/WtYzHTXHBp0).
   - Create a `PayPal account` and `Sandbox account`. Find Tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtZGoueL4Vs&t=293s)

3. **Project Setup**

   - Clone this Repository or Download the zip File.
     ```
      >> git clone https://github.com/nil1729/food-order-app.git
     ```
   - Create a new file named `secret.json` on `config` directory which contains Generated Private keys on Firebase project.

     ```
         {
             "type": "service_account",
             "project_id": "",
             "private_key_id": "",
             "private_key": "",
             "client_email": "",
             "client_id": "",
             "auth_uri": "",
             "token_uri": "",
             "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
             "client_x509_cert_url": ""
         }

     ```

   - Create another `cofig.js` file on `/client/src/firebase`. Put all firebase config Credentials for Frontend. (In following Format)

     ```
       const firebaseConfig = {
           apiKey: "",
           authDomain: "",
           databaseURL: "",
           projectId: "",
           storageBucket: "",
           messagingSenderId: "",
           appId: "",
           measurementId: ""
       };

       export default firebaseConfig;
     ```

   - Create a `.env` file on root directory. Which Contains all necessary Secret Credentials (for backend only) for this site.
     ```
      DB_URI = <- Mongo Atlas URI ->
      PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = <- PayPal Sandbox Client ID (Also use your own client ID on Frontend) ->
      PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = <- PayPal Sandbox Client Secret (Only for backend server to verify purchase) ->
     ```
   - Run this command

     ```
      >> npm run dev  // to start Vue Development server and Backend server together.

      >> npm run server // to start only Backend server

      >> npm run Client // to start Vue Development server only (But it will not working alone as api depends on Backend also)

     ```

4. **Admin Setup**

Some guidelines related to the code:

- Try to stick to the syntax style followed in the code(Especially in Frontend Part). This will help everyone to understand your code.
- Make sure you put comments wherever necessary.
- Include a visual preview (a screenshot or a GIF? if you are working on Frontend Part & For Backend make sure to document the API on your Pull Request or any other format (eg. POSTMAN Doc)) for any visual design changes if possible.

If you want to add a new feature, feel free to do so! :D

Happy Coding! :smiley:
