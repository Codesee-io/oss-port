<Overview>

Today, as the world faces the Covid-19 Pandemic, the world has entered lockdown mode, with partial lockdown varying across demography. People are confused about a lot of things and wish to consult medical professional advice. However, lockdown restricts this luxury and hence it becomes very convenient to have a chatbot that can answer your basic medical queries.

Aarogya Bot can attempt to answer your queries about a limited set of diseases as of now. It can tell you about its symptoms, precaution and description of the disease. In case it can't answer your queries, or if you feel unsatisfied by the response, you are strongly adviced to consult a medical professional. Since this is a vanilla implementation of our chatbot, we strongly advice against blind faith in the responses.
