<Contributing>

For the moment there is no community around this project.
It is started by me (gmuraru) to add interesting snippets of code that you coded/used/seen and you want to share with other people.
Ideally, the contributed code is showcasing how to do one thing and and how do to it well in a **simple and in a beautiful way**.
