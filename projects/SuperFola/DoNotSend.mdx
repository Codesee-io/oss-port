<Overview>

The DNS protocol is conventionally used to ask for the IP address of a given website. Here it's used to send messages and retrieve other messages, instead of asking for a website IP address and retrieving its IP address.
  
This tool can be used to send messages by exploiting a flaw in the DNS protocol, but it could be used (as someone pointed out in [the reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/l0ubhs/hacking_the_dns_protocol_to_use_it_as_a_messaging/)) to exfiltrate data from a network. I'm not responsible for any misuse of the project. Also note that it's most likely that your ISP is logging your DNS queries, thus it's not a 100% anonymous.

Get started by checking out the [chatserver over DNS](https://github.com/SuperFola/DoNotSend/blob/master/src/chatserver.py) sample ; you can even try it out by sending your DNS requests to `chat.dns.12f.pl` with the [provided client script](https://github.com/SuperFola/DoNotSend/blob/master/client.sh).

Check out the [issues](https://github.com/SuperFola/DoNotSend/issues) if you want to contribute to the project, and don't forget to have fun with it!
