<Overview>

Password-Manager is meant to be a learning tool for Go Lang.
But it is a quite useful tool for CLI password management, 
so you can store and customize the options of storage of your passwords.
The previous focus was to provide an API for using alongside another tool of SSH and probably a JWT.
And add different kinds of storage, maybe even apply to Vaults (HashiCorp).
