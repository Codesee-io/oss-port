Arrange the pieces of the world! You need to drag the shape of the territory to the right place. 
Just like in childhood we collected pictures piece by piece, so here you can collect a country 
from regions or whole continents from countries! 

Furthermore second variation is the Quiz. In the Quiz you need find the country by flag, emblem 
or the capital.

The installation process was described in README.md. It is a little bit tricky, so do not hesitate to ask me.

I speak Russian and English.
