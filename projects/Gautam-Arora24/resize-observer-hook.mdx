<Overview>
"resize-observer-hook" is a ‚öõÔ∏è React hook that monitors an element (provided with ref) and provides the height and width of that element dynamically using Native Resize Observer API.
<br/>
<br/>
We usually use media queries to change the style of a particular element but media queries are great for updating layouts at specific points when the viewport changes sizes, but what if we want to change the style of an element based on the size of another element. We can use this library for the same case.
Currently, the library is in the initial stage, and there are a lot more things that need to be added like Types support, Testing for different cases, more props and etc. So, if you are interested to contribute to the library, you are welcomed üôÇ.
<br/>Do ‚≠êÔ∏è the repo.

Any feedback or suggestions are appreciated üëã
