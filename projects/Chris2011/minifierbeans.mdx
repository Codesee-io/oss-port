## Description

Plugin to minify JS , CSS and HTML for quicker page load times by reducing the size of js/css/html files.
This plugin remove all unnecessary characters from source code, without changing its functionality. These unnecessary characters usually include white space characters, new line characters, comments, and sometimes block delimiters, which are used to add readability to the code but are not required for it to execute.

- To minify all js , css or html , right click on folder in netbeans and select Minify WEB Content option ; it will minify all css & js file.
- To minify single js/css/html file , right click on js/css/html file in netbeans and select Minify JS/CSS/HTML option to minify file.

Also optimize by compressing image PNG/JPEG (Currently Supported format) and provides other functionality such as image Base64 Encoder/Decoder .
