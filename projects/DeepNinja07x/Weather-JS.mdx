<Overview>

A simple API-based weather web application made using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Its working process is simple: it takes the name of the City as input from the user and creates an HTTP request and sends it to Openweathermap.org API to get back the details in the form of a JSON Response. Out of all the details the following details are shortlisted:

* Temperature of the City
* Climatic condition of the City
* Humidity
* Wind Speed (Km/h)
