<Overview>

DockerSlim is a tool for developers that provides a set of commands to simplify and optimize your developer experience with containers. It makes your containers better, smaller, and more secure.

The tool is known for its container minification capabiliest where you can generate container images many times smaller than your orignal images (10x, 30x or even more).

DockerSlim also helps you understand your containers and what's inside them with its `xray` command.

Try running DockerSlim to learn more about these and other capabilities it has.
