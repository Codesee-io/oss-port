<Overview>

This is a great starting point for people who want to work on things like [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) or
  [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) without havig to worry about a framework for writing and maintaining a
  consistent structure. The idea is that this can even be used on a smart phone running termux, great for holiday
  hacking.

I'm constantly thinking how I can support more puzzle projects and how to make it easier for people that are just starting
  out on their coding journey. Do you think you could be part of their journey too?

There's also a list of issues that are a great starting point to contributing. I try to operate a talk-first approach so please
  raise an issue with any enhancements you think might be valuable
