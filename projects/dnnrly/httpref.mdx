<Overview>
  
This tool allows you to have a handy reference to many of the things your average frontend or backend developer
  will need to know over the course of the day. It's easy to search for that elusive `414` status code from your
  terminal. Perhaps the details for the `Referer` header or even what usually listens on port `512`. It's all
  there at your fingertips without having to touch the browser. And if you want to find out more, each entry
  includes a URL for you to explore more.

I'm always looking for new things to add. Or perhaps I missed something or messed up. Please feel free to fill in
  those gaps.

There's also a list of issues that are a great starting point to contributing. I try to operate a talk-first approach so please
  raise an issue with any enhancements you think might be valuable
