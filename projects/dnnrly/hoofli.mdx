<Overview>
  
This tool allows you to convert browser network logs in to meaningful PlantUML diagrams. This is incredibly useful
  when you are exporing complex browswer interactions and you just need to see what's going on.

There is a lot of scope to add improvments here. At the moment there's not really any support for specific browsers
  and the richer information that they provide. And I'll be honest, the diagrams that it produces at the moment are
  pretty basic. Perhaps you can find a way of tracking how pages are reloaded? Or maybe find out which JS script
  makes certain HTTP calls?

There's also a list of issues that are a great starting point to contributing. I try to operate a talk-first approach so please
  raise an issue with any enhancements you think might be valuable
