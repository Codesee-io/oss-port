<Overview>

In many embedded systems, you want to react to trigger changes on GPIO pins. This is a bridge between
the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi and an MQTT broker.

<Contributing>

I'm a solo developer making small pieces of software available for anyone to use.
Usually, it's for solving my own problems, but if you find this useful and have ways
to improve it, I would love to hear about it, and will gladly accept pull requests for
new code, documentation, or whatever else you think would be helpful.

This project is a great first project for Rust since it is pretty straightforward, and
I hope easy to understand.
