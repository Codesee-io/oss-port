    - Test classes meeting the regex *Test.java will automatically be included by the framework's test runner
    - In order to run the tests, you must have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed
    - Run the tests by running `mvn test` from the command-line.
- Document the fix in the code to make the code more readable
- File a PR with meaningful title, description and commit messages.
- To close an issue (e.g. issue 1542) automatically after a PR is merged, use keywords "fix", "close", "resolve" in the PR description, e.g. `fix #51`.
