Contribution and feedback is welcome! Please check the issues for TODO. I will be happy every feature or pull request.

We are currently working on opened issues and we would like to create an 2.x version using PHP8 features (Ideally, we
would like to rewrite the core completely).

The short roadmap:

- implement opened [issues](https://github.com/Sibyx/phpGPX/issues) in 1.x version and release LTS
- create PHP8 compatible tests in `develop` branch (covering also the new features from the previous point)
- rewrite the library core using PHP8 features

If you have any questions or you want to help, feel free to contact the maintainers (@Sibyx) directly.
