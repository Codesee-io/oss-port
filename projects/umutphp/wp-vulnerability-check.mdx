<Overview>

WordPress Vulnerability Check (wp-vulnerability-check) is a console application to check the WPScan Vulnerability Database via API to identify the security issues of WordPress plugins installed.

If you're using WordPress as part of your application and third-party WordPress plugins to implement your business logic, you can run wp-vulnerability-check on a CI pipeline to check the vulnerabilities. You should get a token from wpscan.com in order to have access to the API.
