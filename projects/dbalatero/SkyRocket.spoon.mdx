<Overview>

:sunrise_over_mountains: :rocket: This Hammerspoon tool lets you resize and move windows by clicking + dragging them while holding down modifier keys.

This attempts to emulate such things as:

- BetterTouchTool resize/move functions
- Coderage Software's abandoned Zooom/2 software
- Linux desktop move/resize hot keys

I created this to fill the void after Zooom/2 was abandoned by the original developer.
