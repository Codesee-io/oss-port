<Overview>

:milky_way: :keyboard: This library allows you to bind keys to a modifier, and shows you a popup overlay of all your key binds when you hold down the modifier key.

If you have a lot of global key binds to `super`, `hyper`\, or other modifier keys, this Hammerspoon library lets you easily setup your key binds to switch/launch applications or call a function.

As well, if you hold down the modifier key(s), a popup help menu will appear showing you all your key binds:

This was inspired by the Spacemacs [spacebar leader menu](https://www.spacemacs.org/doc/QUICK_START.html#the-leader-keys), and [vim-leader-guide](https://github.com/hecal3/vim-leader-guide).
