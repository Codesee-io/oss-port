<Overview>

The project hosts the developer documentation for the moja global community. You can find the online version of the moja global documentation at [docs.moja.global](https://docs.moja.global).

Moja Global’s mission is to support ambitious climate action by developing pioneering, open-source software – including the FLINT software – to help users accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture, and other land use (AFOLU).

We are building a community of experts, scientists, and developers to create the first open-source source software for MRV systems for the land sector that is affordable, accurate, and fully customizable to a user’s needs and available data, whether the user represents a country, a region, a local government, a company or a project.

The aim of our developer documentation is to support the community by providing a common, open-source, developer-friendly platform for all users to contribute to the documentation and to share their knowledge and experience.
