<Overview>

Moja global’s mission is to support ambitious climate action by developing pioneering, open-source software – including the FLINT software – to help users accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture and other land uses (AFOLU).

We are building a community of experts, scientists and developers to create the first open-source source software for MRV systems for the land sector that is affordable, accurate and fully customizable to a user’s needs and available data, whether the user represents a country, a region, a local government, a company or a project.

Moja global's Community Website is a place where users can find information about the FLINT software, the FLINT software's documentation, and the FLINT software's community. We are also looking to host blogs, community members, community calendar and a roadmap very soon with the help of our contributors.
