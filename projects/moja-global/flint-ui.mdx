<Overview>

FLINT-UI is a web-based user interface for FLINT for configuring simulations using the FLINT.Cloud APIs and run workflows on browser itself. FLINT is a modular and highly flexible open-source software technology designed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals by the land sector.

Moja Global’s mission is to support ambitious climate action by developing pioneering, open-source software – including the FLINT software – to help users accurately and affordably estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture, and other land use (AFOLU).

We are building a community of experts, scientists, and developers to create the first open-source source software for MRV systems for the land sector that is affordable, accurate, and fully customizable to a user’s needs and available data, whether the user represents a country, a region, a local government, a company or a project.

The aim of our project is to create a user-friendly, accessible, and easy-to-use web-based client for FLINT and to collaborate with stakeholders to achieve the same.
