<Contributing>

Contributions are always welcome. You can pick an issue or create one
and resolve it with a pull request. Just please try to stick to standard
Java code style, maybe even adjust neighboring lines if they do not look
good. But no pull requests just for the sake of pretty code. Refactoring
is something else, in fact it is more than welcome, but who has the time
and energy...
