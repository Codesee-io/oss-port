# Preserver Plus

### Minimal notes app with rich text formatting.

This app is built using `Angular` and `Express` platform with `PouchDB` for storing local notes on browser and `CouchDB` to sync notes on cloud.

Otherthan that I've used below open source packages..

- `Superlogin`
- `CKEditor5`
- `Angular2gridster`
- `Ant Design`

## Key Features

- Rich text editor.
- Online/Offline sync with your account.
- WYSIWYG notes.
- Syntax highlighting.
- Toolbar for text formatting.
- Local db and Remote db.
- PWA (Progressive web app).

## Running the app locally

```bash
# Clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/hsbalar/preserver-plus.git

# Go into this repository
$ cd preserver-plus

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

Angular app will be listen on `localhost:4200`.

## Running node server

```bash
# Go into this repository
$ cd server/

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

Node server will be listen on `localhost:4000`.

###### Note: You should have pouchdb installed and instance running on `localhost:5984` to sync up local pouchdb to central couchdb.

## Deployed on
