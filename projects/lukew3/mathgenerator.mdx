Currently, there are 4 main types of contributions
1. Add a generator idea to `futureGenerators.md`. You can add a row to the table manually or run the `addFuture.py` file inside the scripts folder to add your generator idea to the file automatically. Just fill out the prompts!
2. Fix bugs in existing generators. Check out the issues tab of the github to see what bugs exist and need to be fixed.
3. Add latex output formatting to a current generator. To see which generators need latex formatting, run `needsLatex.py` inside of the scripts folder and choose a generator to add latex formatting to.
4. Write a generator. A template and a template with comments is provided in the `mathgenerator/funcs` directory

If you find something else that you'd like to work on, leave an issue or make a pr, and I'll be sure to review it!
