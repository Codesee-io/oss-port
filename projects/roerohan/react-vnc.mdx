<Overview>

[noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) is a VNC client web application using which you can view a VNC stream directly on a browser. It uses [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) to convert the VNC stream into a websocket stream, which can be viewed on a browser. This library provides a `React` component wrapper around the `noVNC` web client.

Using this library, you can easily display a VNC stream on a page of your web application.
