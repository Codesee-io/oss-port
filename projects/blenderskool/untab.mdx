UnTab was a project that was started during [FOSS Hack 2020](https://fossunited.org/fosshack/2020). It was well
received by the community and was also one of the winning projects in this hackathon.

UnTab is still at a fairly early stage and there's a lot of features on the roadmap, some of which have already been
added thanks to other contributors. The project also encourages first-time contributors who are just getting started
with open source. It does not require a very deep understanding of the codebase to make the first contribution and also
has well documented steps to get you started.
