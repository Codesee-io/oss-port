I am always looking for designers, developers and maintainers! You contribute because:


- NextJs is a level up to react, contribute if you want to level up your development game!
- A good place to start is by raising a PR request at the repo or mailing me at ankushors789@gmail.com
- Stuck on what to do? Connect with me on discord Akumazaar#0485 or mail me at ankushors789@gmail.com
