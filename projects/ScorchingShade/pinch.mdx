I am always looking for designers, developers and maintainers! You contribute because:

- CSS is awesome and you get to learn CSS from scratch creating your own library!
- You get access to my official book on CSS on amazon - CSS Bullets, for free!
- A good place to start is by raising a PR request at the PinchX repo or mailing me at ankushors789@gmail.com
- Stuck on what to do? Connect with me on discord Akumazaar#0485 or mail me at ankushors789@gmail.com
