## Build

This bot is hosted on Google cloud functions for better scalability and less maintainance. 

The project is based on Python 3.6, make sure you have the correct python version by using `python --version` or `python3 --version`. 

- ```pip3 install virtualenv```
- Create a new virtual environment for the project.
  ```virtualenv -p python3 ./env```
- Activate the environment created in the last step.
  ```source ./env/bin/activate```
- Install the dependancies. 
  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Now, you can work and add your logic in the `lambda_function.py`. This is the main file which runs when we receive a telegram API webhook. After you are done, just create a zip and upload it to AWS Lambda.
- Use the following command to deploy to google cloud function. 
  ```gcloud functions deploy <FUNCTION_NAME> --runtime python38 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --region asia-south1 --entry-point=lambda_handler```

### Connecting Telegram 

- Use Telegram's BotFather to create a new bot and add the corresponding bot token as environment variable named `BOT_TOKEN`. 
- After the cloud function deployment is done, we need to add a new webhook url to get updates. Copy the cloud function public URL and use the guide [here](https://xabaras.medium.com/setting-your-telegram-bot-webhook-the-easy-way-c7577b2d6f72) to create a new webhook.
